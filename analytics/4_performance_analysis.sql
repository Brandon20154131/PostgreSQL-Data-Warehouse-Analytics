Performance Analysis
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To evaluate and compare performance across key dimensions such as customers, products, categories and time periods.
    - To identify top-performing customers or products and assess their year-over-year growth and performance against averages.
    - To support business insights like customer retention, product success and category contribution.

Key SQL Functions Used:
    - Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER(), LAG(), AVG(), PARTITION BY for ranking and comparative metrics.
    - Aggregate Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), ROUND() for performance measurement.
    - Conditional Logic: CASE for classifying performance trends.
